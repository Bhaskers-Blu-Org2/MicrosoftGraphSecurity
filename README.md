# Microsoft Graph Security PowerShell Module [ Unofficial]
Welcome to the Unofficial Microsoft Graph Security PowerShell module!

This module is a collection of easy-to-use cmdlets and functions designed to make it easy to interface with the Microsoft Graph Security API.

Why is it unofficial, you ask? Even though this module was designed by Microsoft employees, it is NOT a formal part of the Graph Security API product and you will not be able to get support through standard Microsoft channels. That said, if you have problems or questions, please open an issue here on this Github repo. The authors will be more than happy to help. 


## Prerequisites

To get value from this module you must...


...have PowerShell v5+ (comes standard on Windows 10)
...have configured authorization for acess.  See [Authorization and the Microsoft Graph Security API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/security-authorization)

## Getting Started

To get started with the module, open your PowerShell terminal as an administrator and install the module from the PSGallery by running this simple command:
```
Install-Module MicrosoftGraphSecurity
```
If this is your first time installing a module, you will get prompted to install the Nuget Package Provider. Nuget is the Package/Module manager used by the PSGallery repository.
